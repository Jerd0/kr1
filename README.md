Introduction
============

This is the baseline system for the [Acoustic scene classification task (Task 1)](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification) in Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2020 (DCASE2020) challenge. The system is intended to provide a simple entry-level state-of-the-art approach that gives reasonable results in the subtasks of Task 1. The baseline system is built on [dcase_util](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/dcase_util) toolbox (>=version 0.2.16). 

Participants can build their own systems by extending the provided baseline system. The system has all needed functionality for the dataset handling, acoustic feature storing and accessing, acoustic model training and storing, and evaluation. The modular structure of the system enables participants to modify the system to their needs. The baseline system is a good starting point especially for the entry level researchers to familiarize themselves with the acoustic scene classification problem. 

If participants plan to publish their code to the DCASE community after the challenge, building their approach on the baseline system could potentially make their code more accessible to the community. DCASE organizers strongly encourage participants to share their code in any form after the challenge.

Subtasks
========

### Subtask A - Acoustic Scene Classification with Multiple Devices

[TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile Development dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3819968) is used as development dataset for this task.

This subtask is concerned with the basic problem of acoustic scene classification, in which it is required to classify a test audio recording into one of ten known acoustic scene classes. This task targets **generalization** properties of systems across a number of different devices, and will use audio data recorded and simulated with a variety of devices. 
Recordings in the dataset were made with three devices (A, B and C) that captured audio simultaneously and 6 simulated devices (S1-S6). Each acoustic scene has 1440 segments (240 minutes of audio) recorded with device A (main device) and 108 segments of parallel audio (18 minutes) each recorded with devices B,C, and S1-S6. The dataset contains in total 64 hours of audio. For a more detailed description see [DCASE Challenge task description](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification).

The subtask specific baseline system is implemented in file `task1a.py`.

#### System description

The system is a modification of the baselines from previous DCASE challenge editions of acoustic scene classification, however, it replaces use of log mel energies with use of OpenL3 embeddings and replaces the CNN network architecture with two fully-connected feed-forward layers (size 512 and 128) as in the original OpenL3 publication:

J. Cramer, H-.H. Wu, J. Salamon, and J. P. Bello. Look, listen and learn more: design choices for deep audio embeddings. In IEEE Int. Conf. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 3852â€“3856. Brighton, UK, May 2019.

##### Parameters

###### Audio embeddings

- OpenL3 embedding
- Analysis window size: 1 second, Hop size: 100 ms
- Embeddings parameters: 
    - Input representation: mel256
    - Content type: music
    - Embedding size: 512

###### Neural network

- Architecture: Two fully connected layers (512 and 128 hidden units)
- Learning: 200 epochs (batch size 64), data shuffling between epochs
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate 0.001)
- Model selection:
    - Approximately 30% of the original training data is assigned to validation set, split done such that training and validation sets do not have segments from the same location and both sets have data from each city
    - Model performance after each epoch is evaluated on the validation set, and best performing model is selected
    
#### Results for development dataset

The cross-validation setup provided with the *TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile Development dataset* is used to evaluate the performance of the baseline system. Results are calculated using TensorFlow in GPU mode (using Nvidia Titan XP GPU card). Because results produced with GPU card are generally non-deterministic, the system was trained and tested 10 times, and mean and standard deviation of the performance from these 10 independent trials are shown in the results tables.

### Subtask B - Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification

[TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 3Class Development dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3670185) is used as development
dataset for this task.

This subtask is concerned with classification of audio into three major classes (indoor, outdoor and transportation). The task targets low complexity solutions for the classification problem in term of model size, and uses audio recorded with a single device (device A, 48 kHz / 24bit / stereo). The data for the dataset was recorded in 10 acoustic scenes which were later grouped into three major classes used in this subtask. The dataset contains in total 40 hours of audio. For a more detailed description see [DCASE Challenge task description](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification).

Classifier complexity for this subtask is limited to 500KB size for the non-zero parameters. This translates into 128K parameters when using float32 (32-bit float) which is often the default data type (128000 parameter values * 32 bits per parameter / 8 bits per byte= 512000 bytes = 500KB). See detailed description how to calculate model size from [DCASE Challenge task description](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification). Model calculation for Keras models is implemented in `model_size_calculation.py`

The subtask specific baseline system is implemented in file `task1b.py`.

#### System description

The system implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach, where log mel-band energies are first extracted for each 10-second signal, and a network consisting of two CNN layers and one fully connected layer is trained to assign scene labels to the audio signals. Model size of the baseline is 450.1 KB.

### Operation modes

The system can be used in three different operation modes.

**Development mode** - `dev`

In development mode, the development dataset is used with the provided cross-validation setup: training set is used for learning, and testing set is used for evaluating the performance of the system. This is the default operation mode. 

Usage example: `python task1a.py` or `python task1a.py -m dev`

**Challenge mode** - `eval` 

**Note:** This operation mode does not work yet as the evaluation dataset has not been published. 

In challenge mode, the full development dataset (including training and test subsets) is used for learning, and a second dataset, evaluation dataset, is used for testing. The system system outputs are generated based on the evaluation dataset. If ground truth is available for the evaluation dataset, the output is also evaluated. This mode is designed to be used for generating the DCASE challenge submission, running the system on the evaluation dataset for generating the system outputs for the submission file. 

Usage example: `python task1a.py -m eval` and `python task1b.py -m eval`

To save system output to a file: `python task1a.py -m eval -o output.csv`

### System parameters

The baseline system supports multi-level parameter overwriting, to enable flexible switching between different system setups. Parameter changes are tracked with hashes calculated from parameter sections. These parameter hashes are used in the storage file paths when saving data (features/embeddings, model, or results). By using this approach, the system will compute features/embeddings, models and results only once for the specific parameter set, and after that it will reuse this precomputed data.

#### Parameter overwriting

Parameters are stored in YAML-formatted files, which are handled internally in the system as Dict like objects (`dcase_util.containers.DCASEAppParameterContainer`). **Default parameters** is the set of all possible parameters recognized by the system. **Parameter set** is a smaller set of parameters used to overwrite values of the default parameters. This can be used to select methods for processing, or tune parameters.

#### Parameter file

Parameters files are YAML-formatted files, containing the following three blocks:

- `active_set`, default parameter set id
- `sets`, list of dictionaries
- `defaults`, dictionary containing default parameters which are overwritten by the `sets[active_set]`

At the top level of the parameter dictionary there are parameter sections; depending on the name of the section, the parameters inside it are processed sometimes differently. Usually there is a main section (`feature_extractor`, and method parameter section (`feature_extractor_method_parameters`) which contains parameters for each possible method. When parameters are processed, the correct method parameters are copied from method parameter section to the main section under parameters. This allows having many methods ready parametrized and easily accessible.

#### Parameter hash

Parameter hashes are MD5 hashes calculated for each parameter section. In order to make these hashes more robust, some pre-processing is applied before hash calculation:

- If section contains field `enable` with value `False`, all fields inside this section are excluded from the parameter hash calculation. This will avoid recalculating the hash if the section is not used but some of these unused parameters are changed.
- If section contains fields with value `False`, these fields are excluded from the parameter hash calculation. This will enable to add new flag parameters without changing the hash. Define the new flag such that the previous behaviour is happening when this field is set to false.
- All `non_hashable_fields` fields are excluded from the parameter hash calculation. These fields are set when `dcase_util.containers.AppParameterContainer` is constructed, and they usually are fields used to print various values to the console. These fields do not change the system output to be saved onto disk, and hence they are excluded from hash.


## Extending the baseline

Easiest way to extend the baseline system is by modifying system parameters. To do so one needs to create a parameter file with a custom parameter set, and run system with this parameter file.

**Example 1**

In this example, one creates MLP based system. Data processing chain is replaced with a chain which calculated mean over 500 feature vectors. Learner is replaced with a new model definition. Parameter file `extra.yaml`:

    python task1a.py -p extra.yaml

**Example 2**

In this example, one slightly modifies the baseline for subtask B system to have smaller network. Learner is replaced with modified model definition. Since `cnn` learner method is overloaded, only a subset of the parameters needs to be defined. However, the model config (network definition) has to be redefined fully as list parameters cannot be overloaded partly. Parameter file `extra.yaml`:
